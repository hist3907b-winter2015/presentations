weekly in-class presentations
=============

These presentations are made with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). They can be viewed here as markdown formatted files (and so, printed nicely). Here they are [live](http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/presentations/#/).

Here's [how to host reveal.js on github](https://cynng.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/using-reveal-js-on-github-pages-for-your-presentations/).
