## Today's agenda
1. Doing history differently
2. Online identity audit
3. How're the exercises going?

Note: next day, assessing each other's digital identity hqs, online notebooks: what would improve these?


## Doing history: 
Key elements? Similarities, differences, with other fields?

Note: Key difference: reproducibility not necessarily a driving motive.

- open source software: this project is dead and I want nothing further with it, so here you go

- open source software: this project is alive and why don't you help make something cool!

- which of these matches historians' practices (broadly conceived)?


## How is 'failure' framed?

## Chad Black: Papers of You

+ Making research process transparent would open to the world the mystical reality of what it is academic historians do with their time.


+ Making research process and materials available would demonstrate a commitment to the scholarly values of exchange, integrity, and open access that represent the better parts of academics' nature.


+ Distributed self-generated collections of archival material will build access particularly to resources from countries without the resources to do it all themselves.


+ Students would get access to the nitty gritty


+ It'd keep people honest

## Michelle Moravec
>the piece was rejected. I spiraled into the usual impostor syndrome hole of shame and shelved the piece until I got an email from a prominent scholar who had corresponded with me when I’d first started writing it in public. She was citing my work in her book.  Was what audiences always asked me about going to happen? Was I getting scooped on my own research?

> The truth is that we often don't realize the value of what we have until someone else sees it"

+ What about Caulfield?

## Easy for you to say, Graham. 
### What are the risks, rewards for students?

## Making our 'papers of you' available is one thing. 
### Making them findable, quite another.
